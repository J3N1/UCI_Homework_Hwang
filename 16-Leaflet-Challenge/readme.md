# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet
## Background
### Level 1: Basic Visualization
+ Created a [logic.js](https://github.com/J3N1/UCI_Homework_Hwang/blob/master/16-Leaflet-Challenge/Leaflet-Step-1/static/js/logic.js) file to write the JavaScript code to create a leaflet light map to show all the earthquakes from the past 7 days on the [index.html page](https://github.com/J3N1/UCI_Homework_Hwang/blob/master/16-Leaflet-Challenge/Leaflet-Step-1/index.html). Each circle represents the magnitude of each earthquake.<br>
