# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots
## Background
+ Used the Pandas Library, the Jupyter Notebook, and the Matplotlib Library to aggregate various data on mice that were treated through a variety of drug regimens:<br>
  - Observations and Insights of the data<br>
  - Bar Chart showing the total number of mice for each drug regimen<br>
  - Pie Chart showing the distribution of female and male mice <br>
  - Quartiles and IQR for the Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin regimens<br>
  - Box and Whiskey Plot of the final tumor volume of the four drug regimens<br>
  - Line Plot for the mouse s185<br>
  - Scatter Plot of Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume for the Capomulin Regimen<br>
  - Correlation Coefficient and Linear Regression Model between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume for the Capomulin Regimen<br>
