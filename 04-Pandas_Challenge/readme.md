# Pandas Homework - PyCity Schools
## Background
+ Used the Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook to aggregate various data on student's math and reading scores in order to show the following trends in:<br>
  - District Summary<br>
  - School Summary<br>
  - Top Performing Schools<br>
  - Worst Performing Schools<br>
  - Math Scores by Grade<br>
  - Reading Scores by Grade<br>
  - Scores by School Spending<br>
  - Scores by School Size<br>
  - Scores by School Type<br>
## Files
+ The jupyter notebook file show the report the includes the trends mentioned above: 
  - [PyCitySchools](https://github.com/J3N1/UCI_Homework_Hwang/blob/master/04-Pandas_Challenge/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_main.ipynb)
## Analysis
+ Based on the final report:
  - It looks like the charter schools in the district have overall better test scores than the district schools.<br>
  - Charter schools look like they have a smaller amount of students which seems to be correlated to the smaller school budget and per student budget amount.<br>
  - The charter schools in the district all have about the same average math and reading scores. The same can be said for the district schools as well.<br> 
  - It looks like schools with the smaller spending ranges per student had the highest overall passing percentage.<br>
